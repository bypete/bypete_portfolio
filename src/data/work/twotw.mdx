## Overview

<p class="text-step-2/snug font-medium ">Originally created to promote the discography of **Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds**, the site quickly evolved to become the primary resource for explaining the story, connecting with fans, and introducing new listeners to the TWOTW experience.</p>

A tour section was subsequently included to promote the hugely successful live musical version - _Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of The Worlds - Alive on Stage!_ - as it toured the UK and Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.

User engagement was critical to the site's success because the album had a large and devoted fan base. The forum grew to a community of over **20k users** with **19 message boards** and over **3.2K topics**. The brand had numerous social and merchandising channels so the website needed to be the central hub that connected everything.

The site promoted and then documented **8 Arena tours**, culminating in the _40<sup>th</sup> Anniversary UK tour_ in 2018.

## My Skills and Contributions
</Skills>

## My responsibilities

-   The designs and static templates were hosted in a secure listing to keep stakeholders informed throughout the development process. <span class="label-info m-0!">Project management</span>
-   I designed the visual layouts in Photoshop and oversaw all revisions to ensure the client was satisfied with the proposed solution.
-   I created all of the Front-End HTML templates. These were then handed over to a team of back-end developers, complete with detailed annotations, listing indexes, and support documentation.
-   I assisted in configuring the content management system (Custom) and oversaw the testing of the transferred site content throughout the development process. <span class="label-info m-0!">collaboration</span>
-   The client could write newsletters and some news items, but I was in charge of populating the majority of the content. Each tour or album release was usually preceded by a minor site rebranding.
