## Overview

<p class="text-step-1">Kalixa Pay was marketed as a cost-effective contactless prepaid Mastercard with exclusive travel benefits. The site had to sell the product to potential customers, deliver relevant content to existing customers, and give access to accounts in a secure PCI environment.</p>

Highly targeted landing pages were used to convert prospects into cardholders. The site had to accommodate a global affiliate network that was driving traffic towards it from the UK, Germany and Italy.

The landing pages had to be consistent, quick and easy to implement, and responsive on smaller devices.

## My Skills and Contributions
</Skills>

## My responsibilities

-   The static templates were hosted in a secure listing to keep stakeholders informed throughout the development process. <span class="label-info m-0!">Project management</span>
-   The first designs were created in-house and delivered as Photoshop PSD files. I then extrapolated a full site of templates from these, using my experience to improve the UX/UI as needed.
-   The static templates were then handed over to a team of back-end developers, complete with detailed annotations, listing indexes, and support documentation. They built the CMS, which I would use to produce new campaigns.
-   I created a set of multilingual email HTML templates to support each campaign.
-   I assisted in configuring the content management system (EPiServer) and took responsibility for the initial population of all launch content. <span class="label-info m-0!">collaboration</span>
-   Briefs for landing pages were typically delivered as `.ppt` documents with composed artwork. I'd convert them into suitable assets and then build the pages in EPiServer, an enterprise-grade CMS. Most campaigns required multilingual versions, and some were regionalized as well.

The website was the central hub of all Kalixaâ€™s marketing activity. The content needed to be updated rapidly but also accurately in accordance with any regulatory requirements.
