## Performance

The live site performs well and adopts a variety of best practice methods to stay optimized. The site is built in Astro, a performant <abbr title="Static Site Generator">SSG</abbr>. It deploys to Netlify via a linked repository on GitHub and makes use of Netlify's serverless form handing. 

 The chrome [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview) results are excellent.

## UX/UI
The site is presented in a light or dark theme based on the users device preference. This can also be switched with the header icon which switches from sun to moon. All of the colours in the site are set via CSS variables and are overwritten if the attribute `data-theme=dark` is present in the root `<html>` tag. 

```
@layer base {
  :root {
      --surface-10: 0deg 0% 100%; /* #FFFFFF */
      --surface: 180deg 0% 98.4%; /* #FBFBFB */
      --surface--10: 80deg 10% 95%; /* #F7F8F8 */
      --surface--20: 80deg 5% 92%; /* #EBECEA */
      --surface--100: 209deg 61% 10%; /* #0A1A29 */
      
      ...

      /* Semantic Tailwind variables */
      --color-surface-raised: var(--surface-10);
      --color-surface: var(--surface);
      --color-surface-sunken: var(--surface--10);
      --color-surface-sunk: var(--surface--20);
      --color-surface-bedrock: var(--surface--100);
  }

  /* Alpine will set data-theme value based on (prefers-color-scheme: dark) */
  :root[data-theme='dark'] {
      --surface-10: 240deg 12% 20%; /* #2D2D39 */
      --surface: 240deg 13% 14%; /* #1F1F28 */
      --surface--10: 240deg 13% 10%; /* #16161D */
      --surface--20: 240deg 13% 8%; /* #121217 */
      --surface--100: 240deg 13% 6%; /* #0D0D11 */
      ...
  }
}    
```

These semantic vars are then referenced in `tailwind.config.cjs`. The human friendly naming keeps the file readable.

The resultant Tailwind class would be `bg-surface-sunken` or `bg-surface`. This design system ensures consistency when adding new elements. Any edits to the colour values will cascade through the CSS. 

```
surface: {
    raised: 'hsl(var(--color-surface-raised) / <alpha-value>)',
    DEFAULT: 'hsl(var(--color-surface) / <alpha-value>)',
    sunken: 'hsl(var(--color-surface-sunken) / <alpha-value>)',
    sunk: 'hsl(var(--color-surface-sunk) / <alpha-value>)',
    bedrock: 'hsl(var(--color-surface-bedrock) / <alpha-value>)',
    overlay: 'hsl(var(--color-surface-overlay) / <alpha-value>)',
},
```


<Lightbox collections={[{
            id: 'shirleychauffeurs',
        },
        {
            id: 'shirleychauffeurs-dark',
            title: 'Dark mode',
        },
        {
            id: 'shirleychauffeurs-ux',

Light and dark themes are available. A user's system preference is retrieved using vanilla js, and then managed with Alpine.js and local storage.

Just a quick note to say what a fantastic job your driver and Gordon did for us on our wedding...
```

A custom helper function parses titles that have been wrapped with asterisks for emphasis. This function wraps *utterly* with the Underlined component and applies an absolute positioned svg. This simplifies the MDX files. 

```
// Helper function to parse underlined titles
export function parseTitle(title) {
    return title.split(/(\*[^*]+\*)/).map((part, index) => 
        part.startsWith('*') && part.endsWith('*')
            ? { type: 'emphasized', content: part.slice(1, -1), key: index }
            : { type: 'regular', content: part, key: index }
    );
}
```



## Learning points
This was a freelance project that I delivered independently.
It was a good introduction to Netlify's automated deploys and built on my knowledge of Astro. User preferences and themes are now managed using local storage, rather than cookies. 

A lot of attention was given to site optimization and the effort has produced some excellent Lighthouse scores. 

## Scope for improvement
All of the site colours are set with hsl vars and available as Tailwind classes. This allows for precise control, but it results in a significantly large base CSS file.
It also requires a large tailwind.config.cjs file which can be tricky to maintain. The next phase would be to look at Tailwind CSS v4.0 to make use of the improved CSS variables handling.
