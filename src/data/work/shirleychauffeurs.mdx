I was approached to build an online presence that would reflect their professional standards and build trust in their expertise.

## Design system

A comprehensive design system was created in Figma to keep the site consistent. The colour palette is based on shades of blue and cyan, which are associated with trust, reliability, and professionalism. The typography combines a serif font for headings to convey elegance and tradition, with a sans-serif font for body text to ensure readability and a modern feel.

<Image
        src={palette}
        alt="Brand palette"
        class="h-auto w-full col-[pullout]"
        quality={'high'}
        widths={[400, 720]}
        sizes={`720px`}
    />

The **`Brand`** variable collection forms the core palette. An **`Alias`** collection assigns semantic names (like Primary, Secondary), and the **`Mapped`** collection references these for use in classes (such as Surface, Link, Info). The mapped variables also define a light and dark variant.
<Figure bg="transparent" breakout="true" grid="grid grid-cols-2" caption="Light and dark mode colour palettes defined in Figma">
    <Image
        src={light}
        alt="Light mode"
        class=" h-auto max-w-full"
        quality={100}
        widths={[400, 760]}
        sizes={`50%`}
    />     <Image
        src={dark}
        alt="Dark mode"
        class="h-auto max-w-full"
        quality={100}
        widths={[400, 760]}
        sizes={`50%`}
    />
</Figure>

Each brand palette is generated from an initial colour value using tints.dev and then Hue, Saturation and Lightness steps are refined to ensure sufficient contrast and accessibility. The Alias ensures that the brand colours are not referenced
directly in the CSS, which allows for easy updates in the future.

<Figure caption="Figma variables for mapped colours">
    <Image
        src={vars_mapped}
        alt="Alias variables are picked within the Mapped collection"
        class="mx-auto h-auto max-w-full"
        quality={100}
        widths={[400, 760]}
        sizes={`768px`}
    />
</Figure>

<Image
        src={cta}
        alt="Call to action"
        class="h-auto w-full"
        quality={'high'}
        widths={[400, 720, 960]}
        sizes={`768px`}
    />

The layout is clean and uncluttered, with plenty of white space to allow the content to breathe. This minimalist approach helps to focus attention on the key messages and calls to action.

## Performance

The live site performs well and adopts a variety of best practice methods to remain optimized. The site is built in Astro, a performant <abbr title="Static Site Generator">SSG</abbr>. It deploys to Netlify via a linked repository on GitHub and makes use of Netlify's serverless form handling.

The Chrome [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview) results are excellent.

        widths={[400, 760]}
        sizes={`768px`}
    />

## UX/UI

The site is presented in a light or dark theme based on the users device preference. This can also be switched with the header icon which visually toggles from sun to moon. All of the colours in the site are defined via CSS variables and are overwritten when the attribute `data-theme=dark` is present in the root `<html>` tag.

```css
@layer base {
  :root {
      --surface-10: 0deg 0% 100%; /* #FFFFFF */
      --surface: 180deg 0% 98.4%; /* #FBFBFB */
      --surface--10: 80deg 10% 95%; /* #F7F8F8 */
      --surface--20: 80deg 5% 92%; /* #EBECEA */
      --surface--100: 209deg 61% 10%; /* #0A1A29 */

      ...

      /* Semantic Tailwind variables */
      --color-surface-raised: var(--surface-10);
      --color-surface: var(--surface);
      --color-surface-sunken: var(--surface--10);
      --color-surface-sunk: var(--surface--20);
      --color-surface-bedrock: var(--surface--100);
  }

  /* Alpine will set data-theme value based on (prefers-color-scheme: dark) */
  :root[data-theme='dark'] {
      --surface-10: 240deg 12% 20%; /* #2D2D39 */
      --surface: 240deg 13% 14%; /* #1F1F28 */
      --surface--10: 240deg 13% 10%; /* #16161D */
      --surface--20: 240deg 13% 8%; /* #121217 */
      --surface--100: 240deg 13% 6%; /* #0D0D11 */
      ...
  }
}
```

These semantic variables are then referenced in `tailwind.config.cjs`, and the human-friendly naming keeps the file readable.

The resultant Tailwind class would be `bg-surface-sunken` or `bg-surface`. This design system ensures consistency when adding new elements, and any edits to the colour values will cascade throughout the CSS.

Just a quick note to say what a fantastic job your driver and Gordon did for us
on our wedding...
```

A custom helper function parses titles that have been wrapped with asterisks for emphasis. This function wraps `*utterly*` with the Underlined component and applies an absolutely positioned SVG, thereby simplifying the MDX files.

```javascript
// Helper function to parse underlined titles
export function parseTitle(title) {
    return title
        .split(/(\*[^*]+\*)/)
        .map((part, index) =>
            part.startsWith('*') && part.endsWith('*')
                ? { type: 'emphasized', content: part.slice(1, -1), key: index }
                : { type: 'regular', content: part, key: index },
        );
}
```

## Learning points

This was a freelance project that I delivered independently. It was a good introduction to Netlify's automated deployments and helped build my knowledge of Astro. User preferences and themes are now managed using local storage rather than cookies.

A lot of attention was given to site optimization, and the effort has produced some excellent Lighthouse scores.

/>

## Scope for improvement

All of the site's colours are set with HSL variables and made available as Tailwind classes. This allows for precise control, but it results in a significantly large base CSS file. It also requires an extensive `tailwind.config.cjs` file, which can be challenging to maintain. The next phase would be to explore Tailwind CSS v4.0 to take advantage of its improved handling of CSS variables.

## Final thoughts

The site is live and can be viewed at [Shirley Chauffeurs](https://shirleychauffeurs.co.uk/).
