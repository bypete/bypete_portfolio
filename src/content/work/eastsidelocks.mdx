## Overview

Eastside Locks, Birmingham was an urban development of over 650,000 sq ft of prime Grade A office space within three distinct developments at the time of its launch. An inspiring brochure site was commissioned to help deliver their vision and secure prospective clients.

## My responsibilities

-   The static templates were hosted in a secure listing to keep stakeholders informed throughout the development process. <span class="label label--info !m-0">Project management</span>
-   I extrapolated a complete set of Front-End html templates from a sample of .psd mock-ups (supplied by the client’s branding agency). It was critical that the finished product matched the supplied branding exactly - the website needed to reflect the company's distinctive branding across multiple media channels.
-   I was able to make some usability suggestions, but for the most part, the designs had to adhere closely to the supplied visuals.
-   The static templates were then handed over to a team of back-end developers, complete with detailed annotations, listing indexes, and support documentation.
-   I assisted in configuring the content management system (Umbraco) and took responsibility for the initial population of all launch content. <span class="label label--info !m-0">collaboration</span>

## Learning points

The website was commissioned after a significant amount of traditional printed media had already been published. As a result, it was critical that I adhere to all the brand guidelines in order to ensure consistent delivery across all channels. For example, the development's print brochure pdf is available as downloadable content on the website.

I was able to work quickly within the strict guidelines and helped deliver a responsive site that complemented Eastside's emerging position as the city's knowledge, innovation and business quarter.
