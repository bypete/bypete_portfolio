## Overview
<p class="text-fl-step-1">Gamesyouloved.com began as a fun website lovingly curated by gaming enthusiasts and quickly became a huge retro hit. Every genre of game was meticulously documented to help fans relive those sweet nostalgic childhood memories.</p>

The site encouraged the community to submit their own game reviews, effectively crowdsourcing content and giving the fanbase a genuine sense of ownership. An article submission form kept editorial content consistent and streamlined the publishing/moderation process. This was the impetus behind the site's rapid expansion, which until recently, included twelve game genres and several hundred entries.

GYL has a substantial social media presence across multiple platforms and the site served as a central hub for these platforms, allowing for deeper engagement through rich editorial content.

## My Skills and Contributions
</Skills>


## My responsibilities

- My first task was to design the brand logo. An analogue TV brandmark was then introduced to connect with the retro audience and provide a consistent identity across all social channels. This provided a clear visual framework from which to design the site.
<BlockPicture src={gyl_logo} alt="GamesYouLoved Logo" breakout={false} credit={frontmatter.title} class="w-full h-auto max-w-1/2 mx-auto my-fl-space-m" widths={[400, 720]} />

- The designs and static templates were hosted in a secure listing to keep stakeholders informed throughout the development process. <span class="label label--info !m-0">Project management</span>
- Working closely with the client's direction, I created a few key screens for visual approval. The website needed to strike a balance between being distinctively recognisable and also evoking vintage styling from the past.
- I created all of the Front-End HTML templates – working to a mobile-first mindset. These were then handed over to a team of back-end developers, complete with detailed annotations, listing indexes, and support documentation.
- I collaborated closely with the developers to ensure that the site stayed true to the visuals approved by the client.
- I assisted in configuring the content management system (Umbraco) and took responsibility for the initial population of all launch content. <span class="label label--info !m-0">collaboration</span>
- At handover, I provided documentation to help the client understand the different template types as well as instructions on how to populate the content. <span class="label label--info !m-0">Documentation</span>

## Final comments

These images have been captured from static templates, but they accurately represent the site that was launched. Fifth dimension (the agency) reformed as K Wearables, a start-up focused on launching the world’s first contactless payment ring, [K Ring](/work/mykring/), and this site has since been retired.
