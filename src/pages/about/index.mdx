## What I do

Over the years I’ve worked with fintech startups, e-money services, and global brands, delivering high-performing websites and multilingual applications. My background spans creative design, responsive front-end builds, and user-centred problem solving - always with an eye on accessibility and detail.

I help businesses bring their digital visions to life through clean, efficient code and user-friendly designs. My expertise includes:

- UX & UI Design
- Design Systems & Prototyping (Figma)
- Responsive Front-End Development (Tailwind, TypeScript, Astro)
- Accessibility (WCAG)
- Continuous Deployment Workflows (GitHub, Netlify)

## The backstory

I began my career in multimedia, developing engaging e-learning, training, and press pack applications for top-tier clients such as **BBC Worldwide**, **BBC Active**, **University of Cambridge**, **Oxford University Press**, **UKTV**, and **Kellogg's** through the award-winning agency, Fifth Dimension Productions.
As the industry shifted from physical media to online platforms, I adapted by moving into Front-End development — a transition focused on rapid prototyping.

Starting out, I helped build support sites for innovative projects like BBC Active’s [Get Into French](https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/get-into-french-wins-gold-award), an IVCA Gold award winner. Subsequently, I progressed to developing full-fledged online solutions.

## Focus on Fintech and Agile Development

In 2009, the agency refocused its efforts and established itself as _the_ marketing agency for Europe's emerging payments sector. Since then, I've concentrated solely on Front-End development, primarily within the fintech landscape. This environment demands quick, testable solutions, enabling clients and teams to quickly validate ideas and innovate.

## Looking Ahead

This static site was crafted using [Astro v5](https://astro.build/), integrating [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) alongside [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/). It replaces the previous build, which was developed using **11ty** and **Webpack**. I’ve really enjoyed diving into Astro and am excited about exploring its potential for rapid prototyping in future projects.

## Balancing Life and Work

Beyond work, I love spending time outdoors with my family, especially my two young adventurous sons. I have found nature to be a great counterbalance to the demands of development, although we often revert back to technology like [Google Lens](https://lens.google/intl/en-GB/#cta-section) for assistance!
