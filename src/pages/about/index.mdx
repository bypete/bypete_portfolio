## What I do

I have worked with fintech startups, e-money services, and global brands, delivering high-performing websites and multilingual apps that blend functionality and user experience. My work spans creative design, responsive front-end builds, and user-centred problem solving - always with an eye on accessibility and detail. 

I help businesses bring their digital visions to life through clean, efficient code and user-friendly designs. My toolkit includes:

- UI & UX Design
- Design Systems & Prototyping (Figma)
- Responsive Front-End Development (Tailwind, TypeScript, Astro)
- Accessibility (WCAG)
- Continuous Deployment Workflows (GitHub, Netlify)

## The backstory

I began my career in multimedia, developing award-winning e-learning, training, and press pack applications for renowned clients such as **BBC Worldwide**, **University of Cambridge**, and **Oxford University Press**. As the industry shifted online, I embraced the change and pivoted into Front-End development, focusing on rapid prototyping.

Starting out, I helped build support sites for innovative projects like BBC Active’s [Get Into French](https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/get-into-french-wins-gold-award), an IVCA Gold award winner. Subsequently, I progressed to developing full-fledged online solutions.

I shifted my focus to the fintech sector, where I led Front-End development for innovative products such as K Ring, the world’s first Mastercard-powered contactless payment ring. This environment demands quick, testable solutions, enabling clients and teams to rapidly validate ideas and innovate.

## Looking Ahead

I’m always keen to explore new technologies and production methods. 
This static site was crafted using [Astro v5](https://astro.build/), integrating Preact, and [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/). I’ve really enjoyed diving into Astro and have been impressed with its exceptional load times and lighthouse scores.

> <cite>Source: [Google Web.Dev - Why does speed matter?](https://web.dev/learn/performance/why-speed-matters/) </cite>

This site is ‘hand-built’ and should serve as a marker of my capabilities in design and front-end development. 


## Balancing Life and Work

I love exploring the great outdoors with my young family and spending quality time at the nets with my cricket-obsessed sons. During the season, I volunteer as a parent coach at our local cricket club.

Nature is my go-to for recharging and getting offline, but I’m not above using [Google Lens](https://lens.google/intl/en-GB/#cta-section) to identify what we’re discovering!
