## The backstory
I began my career in multimedia, primarily working on e-learning, training, and press pack applications for prominent publishers such as **BBC Worldwide**, **BBC Active**, **University of Cambridge**, **Oxford University Press**, **UKTV**, and **Kellogg's** with the award winning agency - Fifth Dimension Productions.

As the industry shifted from physical (PC/Mac CD-ROMs) to online platforms, I transitioned my skills to Front-End development.  Initially, I crafted support sites for products like BBC Active's [Get Into French](https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/get-into-french-wins-gold-award), an IVCA Gold award winner. Subsequently, I progressed to developing full-fledged online solutions.

## Focus on Fintech
In 2009, the agency refocused its efforts and established itself as **the** marketing agency for Europe's emerging payments sector. Since then, I've concentrated solely on Front-End development, primarily within the fintech landscape.

## Streamlined Workflow
My workflow revolves around static site generators. Initially, I used [Panini](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/panini.html) within the Foundation framework, and more recently [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). This component-based approach improves consistency and facilitates seamless updates across all templates.

Using a <abbr title="Static Site Generator">SSG</abbr>  for prototyping enables me to promptly address client requests and provide reassurance to the development team regarding proposed changes. Maintaining a well-organised set of static templates bridges the communication gap between clients and developers, ensuring alignment and reducing the risk of project scope creep.

## Supporting Multilingual Websites
Recognising the importance of context in translations, I introduced a template index listing system. This supports third-party translators in producing concise translations for multilingual websites. With this resource, translators can easily access a comprehensive listing to understand user pathways or view entire pages without the need for test accounts or sandbox transactions.

## What comes next? 
This static site was crafted using [Astro](https://astro.build/), integrating [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) alongside [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/). It replaces the previous version, which was developed using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). I've enjoyed learning Astro and am eager to explore its potential in upcoming projects.

## Achieving Balance and Wellbeing
Beyond work, I enjoy spending time outdoors with my family, especially my two young and adventurous boys. Exploring nature helps me maintain a sense of balance and wellbeing, although tackling their curiosities often leads us to rely on technology like [Google Lens](https://lens.google/intl/en-GB/#cta-section) for assistance!
