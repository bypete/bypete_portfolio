## The backstory

I began my career in multimedia, developing engaging e-learning, training, and press pack applications for top-tier clients such as **BBC Worldwide**, **BBC Active**, **University of Cambridge**, **Oxford University Press**, **UKTV**, and **Kellogg's** through the award-winning agency, Fifth Dimension Productions.
As the industry shifted from physical media to online platforms, I adapted by moving into Front-End development — a transition focused on rapid prototyping.

Starting out, I helped build support sites for innovative projects like BBC Active’s  [Get Into French](https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/get-into-french-wins-gold-award), an IVCA Gold award winner. Subsequently, I progressed to developing full-fledged online solutions. 

## Focus on Fintech and Agile Development
In 2009, the agency refocused its efforts and established itself as *the* marketing agency for Europe's emerging payments sector. Since then, I've concentrated solely on Front-End development, primarily within the fintech landscape. This environment demands quick, testable solutions, enabling clients and teams to quickly validate ideas and innovate.

## Prototype-Driven Workflow
My development process now centers on static site generators. I started with **Panini** within the [Foundation](https://get.foundation) framework, and and later transitioned to [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) paired with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). I am currently using [Astro](https://astro.build/). This component-based workflow keeps my projects consistent but also allows for fast, reliable updates across templates.

Using a <abbr title="Static Site Generator">SSG</abbr> for prototyping means I can quickly turn client ideas into working models — bridging the gap between initial concept and final product while reducing the risk of scope creep.

  <Image src={listing_index} alt="Devices view" class="w-full h-auto shadow-md border border-line hover:cursor-pointer" />
</Figure>

## Enhancing Multilingual Support
Recognising the importance of context in translations, I introduced a template index system that guides third-party translators. This resource enables translators to review user pathways and full-page layouts without needing extra access to test environments, ensuring that every version of a site retains its intended clarity and usability.

## Looking Ahead 
This static site was crafted using [Astro v5](https://astro.build/), integrating [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) alongside [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/). It replaces the previous build, which was developed using **11ty** and **Webpack**. I’ve really enjoyed diving into Astro and am excited about exploring its potential for rapid prototyping in future projects.

## Balancing Life and Work
Beyond work, I love spending time outdoors with my family, especially my two young adventurous sons. I have found nature to be a great counterbalance to the demands of development, although we often revert back to technology like [Google Lens](https://lens.google/intl/en-GB/#cta-section) for assistance!
